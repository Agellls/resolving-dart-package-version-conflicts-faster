# Resolving Package Version Conflicts

If you found the error like this

```bash
[jarvis] flutter pub get --no-example
Resolving dependencies...
The current Dart SDK version is 3.3.4.

Because firebase_core >=3.5.0 depends on firebase_core_web >=2.18.0 which requires SDK version >=3.4.0 <4.0.0, firebase_core >=3.5.0 is forbidden.
So, because jarvis depends on firebase_core ^3.6.0, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try using the Flutter SDK version: 3.24.3.
exit code 1
```

The [pubspec.yaml]() might look a little something like this:

```dart
dependencies:
  # ...
  cloud_firestore: ^5.4.3
  firebase_core: ^3.6.0
```

# The solution

The fastest way to resolve this problem is to set the versions of both of the conflicting dependencies to any .

```dart
dependencies:
  # ...
  cloud_firestore: any # <- change to any
  firebase_core: any # <- change to any
```

There’s a good chance that the following happens:

```bash
Resolving dependencies...
Got dependencies!
```

# We’re not done yet!

After getting the compatible versions, you should tighten the dependency versions back to use semantic versioning like they previously did.

Open the generated [pubspec.lock]() file and find the dependencies that were previously conflicting.

```bash
# Generated by pub
# See https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/glossary#lockfile
packages:
  cloud_firestore:
    # ...
    version: "5.4.0" # the version of "cloud_firestore" package that worked fine
                     # with "firebase_core".
  firebase_core:
    # ...
    version: "3.4.0" # the version of "firebase_core" package
                      # that worked fine with "cloud_firestore".
```

From that [pubspec.lock](), we can see that the cloud_firestore package version 5.4.0 and firebase_core package version 3.4.0 play along together well. As the last step, replaceany with the correct versions on your [pubspec.yaml]() :

```dart
dependencies:
  cloud_firestore: ^5.4.0
  firebase_core: ^3.4.0
```

Refetch your dependencies one last time by running <i>[flutter package get]()</i> to verify that this does indeed work and then you’re good to go.

Remember ⚠ : <b>(You should never leave your versions as any)</b> that’s simply just asking for trouble. Find the compatible versions from [pubspec.lock]() and use those ones. Having nondeterministic dependencies is a surefire way of breaking your app in hard to debug ways in the future. Just don’t do it.
